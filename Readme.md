#National Admission Agency - Apollo

As part of my undergraduate Computer Science degree at Sheffield Hallam University studing Advanced Web Applications, the Apollo project was developed for the National Admission Agency (a fictitious company similar to UCAS).

The Apollo web application incorporates Entity Framework for data storage and consumes XML Web Services to provide University and course information.

####XML Web Services
Both XML Web services are exposed by the University lecturers at Sheffield Hallam University.

####Application Styling
Apollo uses Raleway, a Google Font and implements the latest Bootstrap components to provide a clean and easy to navigate UI.
